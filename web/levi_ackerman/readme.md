## Solution

After clicking on the link to the target, a webpage is presented with a picture of Mr. Levi Ackerman (I suppose). In the prompt to the challenge, there is a hint that he is not a robot. This hint leads me to check the `robots.txt` of the webpage. The website response is: `Disallow : /l3v1_4ck3rm4n.html`. After checking this page the flag is printed in plaintext:

`KCTF{1m_d01n6_17_b3c4u53_1_h4v3_70}`
