# KnightCTF_2024

## Overview

I participated in KnightCTF with a friend this past weekend (1/20/2024) so here are some of my writeups. Happy Hacking :)

## Challenges

There were a few challenges which I attempted but was not able to solve, but I am going to include how far I got on those challenges too. I will also probably go to [ctftime](https://ctftime.org) to see if there are any writeups for the challenges I didn't solve. Viewing writeups for things I didn't know is (in my opinion) one of the best ways to learn new skills and tools unbeknownst before. To view each challenge, click into each indiviual folder or click the links below.
