## My Attempt

I also didn't get too far on this challenge. I downloaded the attachment and tried to unzip the file. It asked for a password, which I didn't know. Of the files that actually decompressed, there was only one with any data in it, even though I still couldn't open it with any software on my machine. 

I figured the jpg was just not in the correct format for an image. I looked up the bytes for a jpg and tried to replace the hex in the beginning of the file with the correct bytes. Even after I replaced it though no data was able to be recovered to any readable format. 

Kind of struck out with this one too. :(
